[h1]Quasimorph Recycle Hotkey[/h1]


All functionality is configurable.

This mod can optionally let the player use amputation weapons directly from their inventory, without needing to equip them. This feature is disabled by default.

Adds the following functions to the corpse screen:
[list]
[*]Hotkey for the recycle button.  Z by default.
[*]Hotkey to amputate all limbs.  A by default.
[*]Do not recycle certain items.  By default the items are: Ammo, Mine, Grenade, RepairKit, Parts.
[/list]

Optional and disabled by default:
[list]
[*]Allow amputations weapons in inventory to be used instead of needing to equip them.
[*]Do not require a weapon to amputate.
[*]Automatically recycle items and amputate all limbs when the recycle hotkey is pressed.
[*]Do not automatically close the corpse window if there is more than one tab.
[/list]

See the Configuration section below for the options.

[h1]Filtering Out Items[/h1]

Use the mod "I Don't Want That! (Filter pickup items)" to avoid picking up items that are not wanted after recycle/amputation.  For example: legs, hands, flesh, more meat than is inventory, etc.

[h1]Configuration[/h1]

This mod can either be configured via the MCM's Mod button on the main menu, or directly in the config file.
Currently some values can only be edited in the config file.

The configuration file will be created on the first game run and can be found at [i]%AppData%\..\LocalLow\Magnum Scriptum Ltd\Quasimorph_ModConfigs\QM_RecycleHotKey\config.json[/i].

To configure different hotkeys, valid key names can be found at the bottom of https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html

There are some oddities such as the number 1 is actually Alpha1.

[h2]DoNoCloseWindowOnEmpty Option[/h2]

By default, the game will automatically close the corpse dialog if there was only one tab (one corpse, no piles around, etc.) and the corpse is completely empty when the Take All command is executed.  Normally the game doesn't include any tabs that were created by dropping items while that dialog is open.

Note:  At the time of writing, there is a bug where the game's "tab count" is incorrect and will always close the dialog if the current corpse tab is empty on "Take All".  A bug has been filed with the developers.
